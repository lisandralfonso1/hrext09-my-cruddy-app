# hrext09-my-cruddy-app
Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS

 ## General Idea
 This project will be a very simple "I am bored" database, that allows users to select from a variety of interests, and based on these selected interests it provides them with a list of things to do when bored. 
 
 Notes: 
 - I will be individually finishing and styling each MVP as completed. 
 - I feel sort of comfortable with styling, however I have never built CRUD apps, so I intend to focus on learning this process and getting the job done.

 ## Tasks

 ### Basic Reqs
- [ ] Where to store data? (local storage).
- [ ] How to caputure data? (web form).
- [ ] How to modify data? (update action, delete action).
- [ ] How to view data? (style?).
- [ ] UI/UX considerations (how are we going to use this).

### MVPs 
- [ ] Allow users to CRUD interests, which include the interest name and a list of activities, using local storage.  
- [ ] Allow users to select their interests and based on those interests show them a list of things to do when bored. 

### Advanced Reqs
- [ ] Allow users to rate the suggested activities that they were presented with initially.

### Very Advanced Reqs
- [ ] Suggest activities to the users not only based on interests now, but also based on location, and events happening nearby.
